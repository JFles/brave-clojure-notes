(if true
  (do (println "Success!")
      "By zeus's hammer!")
  (do (println "Failure!")

;; We `bind` vars instead of assign in Clojure -- meaning consts of immutable values
;; To avoid unintentional side-effects
;;
;; We can still mutate like we would in other languages ‚ùå

  (def error-message (str error-message "DOOOOOOOMED!")))
error-message

;; Instead of using mutation, a more idiomatic way we could deal with this scenario is through defining a func
(defn error-message
  [severity]
  (str "OH GOD! IT'S A DISASTER! WE'RE "
       (if (= severity :mild)
         "MILDLY INCONVENIENCED!"
         "DOOOOOOOMED!")))

(error-message :mild)

;; `def` should be treated as if it were defining constants
;; We'll learn how to deal with this apparent limitation by embracing the functional programming paradigm

;;;
;;; `Maps`
;;;

;; `maps` are similar to dicts or hashes in other langs.
;; Clj has hash maps and sorted maps


;; empty map
{}

;; map with keyword keys
{ :first-name "Charlie"
  :last-name "McFishwhich" }

;; assoc "string-key" with the `+` func
{ "string-key" + }

;; nested map
{ :name { :first "John"
          :middle "Jacob"
          :last "Pollins"} }

;; We can use a `hash-map` func to create a map
(hash-map :a 1 :b 2)

;; We can look up values in a map with the `get` func
(get {:a 0 :b 1} :b)

(get {:a 0 :b {:c "ho hum"}} :b)

;; `get` will return nil if the key is not found
(get {:a 0 :b 1} :c)

;; We can provide a default value to return if the key is not found
(get {:a 0 :b 1} :c "unicorns?")

;; The `get-in` func allows us to look up values in a nested map
(get-in {:a 0 :b {:c "ho hum"}} [:b :c])

;; Alternatively, we can get the val in a map by treating the map as a func with the key as the arg
({:name "The Human Coffeepot"} :name)


;;;
;;; `Keywords`
;;;

;; keywords are primarily used as keys in maps
:a
:rumplestiltsken
:34
:_?

;; Keywords can be used as funcs that look up a val in a data structure
(:a {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
;; equiv to
(get {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :a)

;; can still provide a default val
(:d {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} "No gnome knows homes like Noah knows")


;;;
;;; `Vectors`
;;;

;; A vector is similar to an array in that it is a 0-indexed collection
[3 2 1]

;; return the nth el of the vec
(get [3 2 1] 0)

;; vecs are heterogeneous
(get ["a" {:name "Bobbo"} "c"] 1)

;; can create vectors with `vector` func
(vector "creepy" "full" "moon")

;; can use `conj` to add addtl els to the vec
;; els are added to the END for vecs w/ `conj`
(conj [1 2 3] 4)


;;;
;;; `Lists`
;;;

;; Lists are similar to vectors in that they're linear collections of vals, but there are differences
;; For ex, can't retrieve list els with `get`

;; Can create a list literal
'(1 2 3 4)

;; Can use the `nth` func to retrieve an el from a list
(nth '(:a :b :c) 0)
(nth '(:a :b :c) 2)
;; As a performance detail, using `nth` w/ a list is slower than using `get` w/ a vector
;; `nth` requires traversal whereas `get` allows random access via the index

;; lists are also heterogeneous
(list 1 "two" {3 4})

;; `conj` adds els to the BEG of lists
(conj '(1 2 3) 4)

;; ‚ÄºÔ∏è `Lists` are good for when we need to add items to beg of seq or when writing a macro
;; Otherwise, use a `Vector`


;;;
;;; `Sets`
;;;

;; Sets are colls of unique vals
;; Clj has two kinds of sets: hash sets and sorted sets

;; literal notation for a hash set
#{"kurt vonnegut" 20 :icicle}

;; can use `hash-set` to create a set
(hash-set 1 1 2 2)

;; adding a duplicate val will be ignored by the set
(conj #{:a :b} :b)

;; can create sets from existing vecs and lists w/ `set` func
(set [3 3 3 4 4])

;; can check membership through `contains?`
(contains? #{:a :b} :a) ;; true
(contains? #{:a :b} 3) ;; false
(contains? #{nil} nil) ;; true
(contains? #{} nil) ;; false


;; `get` works with `sets`
(get #{:a :b} :a) ;; :a
(get #{:a nil} nil) ;; nil
(get #{:a :b} "kurt vonnegut") ;; nil

;; and `keyword` func equivalent
(:a #{:a :b})

;; ‚ÄºÔ∏è Note that using `get` to test whether a set contains nil always returns nil
;; so it would be a better option to use `contains?` when testing for set membership


;;;
;;; `Simplicity`
;;;

;; Clojure encourages us to reach for built-in data structures before classes and structs like with OO.
;; This communicates that data does not need to be tightly bundled with a class for it to be useful.

;; A popular epigram amongst Clojurists that hints at this philosophy is:
;; "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures."
;;   -- Alan Perlis

;; ‚ÄºÔ∏è Keep an eye out for ways to gain code reusability by sticking to basic data structures


;;;
;;; `Functions`
;;;

;; Lisps allow us to build programs that behave in complex ways, yet the primary building block
;; the `function`, is so simple

;;;
;;; `Calling` `Functions`
;;;

;; simple example
(+ 1 2 3 4)
(* 1 2 3 4)
(first [1 2 3 4])

;; funcs that either take a func as an arg or return a func are called `higher-order` `functions`.
;; Languages with higher-order funcs are said to support `first-class` `functions` b/c funcs can be
;; treated like values in the same way as nums or vecs
;;
;; For ex, the `map` func creates a new list by applying a func to each member of a coll
(inc 1.1) ;; inc arg by 1
(map inc [0 1 2 3]) ;; inc each val in coll by 1
(map inc '(0 1 2 3)) ;; and same result with a list


;;;
;;; Function Calls, Macro Calls, and Special Forms
;;;

;; One thing that makes special forms unique as expressions is that they don't always
;; eval all of their operands.
;;
;; Ex is `if`
(if good-mood
  (tweet walking-on-sunshine-lyrics)
  (tweet mopey-country-song-lyrics))

;; We can use `arity-overloading` to define default params
(defn x-chop
  "Describe the kind of chop you're inflicting on someone"
  ([name] ;; order doesn't seem to matter for `multiple-arity` funcs
   (x-chop name "karate"))
  ([name chop-type]
   (str "I " chop-type " chop " name "! Take that!"))
  )

(x-chop "Kanye West")
(x-chop "Kanye West" "slap chop")

;; We can include a variadic param with `&` referred to as the `rest` `parameter`
(defn codger-communication
  [whippersnapper]
  (str "Get off my lawn, " whippersnapper "!!!"))

(defn codger
  [& whippersnappers]
  (map codger-communication whippersnappers))

(codger "Billy" "Anne-Marie" "The Incredible Bulk")

;; we can mix normal params with a rest param, but the rest param needs to come last
(defn favorite-things
  [name & things]
  (str "Hi, " name ", here are my favorite things: "
       (clojure.string/join ", " things))) ;; ignore the warning -- REPL evals it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

(favorite-things "Doreen" "gum" "shoes" "kara-te")

;;;
;;; `Destructuring`
;;;

;; destructuring allows us to concisely bind names to values w/i a coll
(defn return-first-el-in-coll
  [[first-thing]] ;; üëà note that `first-thing` is nested in a vector
  first-thing)

(return-first-el-in-coll ["oven" "bike" "war-axe"])

;; we can also destructure with a rest param
(defn chooser
  [[first-choice second-choice & unimportant-choices]]
  (println (str "Your first choice is: ") first-choice)
  (println (str "Your second choice is: ") second-choice)
  (println (str "\nWe're ignoring the rest of your choices.\n"
                "Here they are in case you need to cry over them: "
                (clojure.string/join ", " unimportant-choices))))

(chooser ["Marmalade" "Handsome Jack" "Pigpen" "Aquaman"])

;; Can destructure maps by providing a map as the param
(defn announce-treasure-location
  [{lat :lat lng :lng}] ;; associates the given name with the value of the provided key
  (println (str "Treasure lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Treasure lng: " lng)))

(announce-treasure-location {:lat 28.22 :lng 81.33})

;; shorthand for breaking keys out of maps
(defn announce-treasure-location
  [{:keys [lng lat]}] ;; associates the given name with the value of the provided key
  (println (str "Treasure lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Treasure lng: " lng)))

(announce-treasure-location {:lat 28.22 :lng 81.33})

;; Can retain access to the orig map arg by using the `:as` keyword
(defn receive-treasure-location
 [{:keys [lat lng foo] :as treasure-location}]
  (println (str "Treasure lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Treasure lng: " lng))
  (println (str "Treasure foo: " foo)) ;; key won't be found, so empty str printed

  ;; a func to enter new coords into our ship
  (steer-ship! treasure-location))

(defn steer-ship!
  [map]
  (println map))

(receive-treasure-location {:lat 28.22 :lng 81.33})

;; To recap `destructuring` is what allows us to associate names with the values in
;; lists, maps, sets, and vectors


;;;
;;; `Function` `Body`
;;;

;; Clojure automatically returns the last form eval'd in a func body
(defn illustrative-function
  []
  (+ 1 304)
  30
  "joe")

(illustrative-function) ;; => "joe"

;; another example using `if`
(defn number-comment
  [x]
  (if (> x 6)
    "Oh my gosh! What a big number!"
    "That number's OK, I guess"))

(number-comment 6) ;; average?
(number-comment 7) ;; c'mon, man


;;;
;;; `Anonymous` `Functions`
;;;

;; There are two ways to create anonymous funcs in Clj
;;
;; The first way is to use the `fn` form
(fn [param-list]
  function body)

;; examples
(map (fn [name] (str "Hi, " name))
     ["Darth Vader" "Mr. Magoo"])

((fn [x] (* x 3)) 8)

;; we can technically associate an anonymous func with a name (same sa `defn` IIRC)
(def my-special-number (fn [x] (* x 3)))
(my-special-number 12)

;; the compact way to create anonymous funcs (my preference ü´∂)
(#(* % 3) 8) ;; 24

(map #(str "Hi, " %)
     ["Darth Vader" "Mr. Magoo"])

;; Anonymous functions in this form are made possible by `reader` `macros`

;; If the anonymous func takes multiple args, you can use `%1` `%2` `%3`
;; where `%` == `%1`
(#(str %1 " and " %2)
 "cornbread" "butter beans")

;; Can also pass a `rest` param with `%&`
(#(identity %&) 1 "blarg" :yip)


;;;
;;; `Returning` `Functions`
;;;

;; Functions can return functions.
;; Returned functions are `closures` which captures enclosing scope

;; Standard example of a closure utilizing enclosing scope
;; `inc-by` is in scope, so the returned func has access to it
;; even when the returned func is used outside of `inc-maker`
(defn inc-maker
  "Create a custom incrementor"
  [inc-by]
  #(+ % inc-by))

(def inc3 (inc-maker 3))

(inc3 7)

;; 1st, Model its body parts
;; - Each body part will only include relative size
;;   - Used to indicate likelihood that part will be hit
;; - model will only include `left` body parts
;;   - Separate func needed to symmetrize `right` body parts from `left`
;;
;; 2nd, create a func to iterate over body parts to determine which to hit

;; `let` binds names to vals

  x)

(def dalmatian-list
  ["Pongo" "Perdita" "Puppy 1" "Puppy 2"])
(let [dalmatians (take 2 dalmatian-list)]
  dalmatians)

;; `let` also introduces a new scope
(def x 0) ;; => x = 0 in the global context
(let [x 1] x) ;; => x = 1 in the context of this `let` exp

;; can ref existing bindings in the `let` binding

;; can also use rest params like in funcs

;;    - Good for expensive ops like network calls

;;; `Symmetrizer`
;;;

;; `symmetrize-body-parts` employs a common strategy in functional programming.

;;;
;;; `Better` `Symmetrizer` `with` `reduce`
;;;

;; The pattern of "process each el in a seq and build a result" is so common that
;; there's a built-in func for it called `reduce`
(reduce + [1 2 3 4]) ;; => 10

;; which is functionally equivalent to
(+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4) ;; => 10 ü•¥

;; `reduce` also takes an optional initial value
(reduce + 15 [1 2 3 4]) ;; => 25

;; Can also use `reduce` to return an even larger coll than the one we start with
;; which is what we want to do with `symmetrize-body-parts`

;; `reduce` abstracts the task "process a collection and build a result" which
;; is agnostic about the type of result returned

;; Here's one way we could implement it
(defn my-reduce
  ([f initial coll]
   (loop [result initial
          remaining coll]
     (if (empty? remaining)
       result
       (recur (f result (first remaining)) (rest remaining)))))
  ([f [head & tail]]
    (my-reduce f head tail)))

;; which would allow us to reimplement our symmetrizer as follows:
(defn better-symmetrize-body-parts
  "Expects a seq of maps that have a :name and :size"
  [asym-body-parts]
  (reduce (fn [final-body-parts part]
            (into final-body-parts (set [part (matching-part part)])))

          asym-body-parts))

    (loop [[part & remaining] sym-parts ;; decompose head & tail to process head
           accumulated-size (:size part)] ;; running sum of `head` el processed

;;; `Summary`
;;;

;; This chapter focuses on how `do` `stuff` with Clojure
;;
;; We've gone through how to represent information using `strings`, `numbers`, `maps`,
;; `keywords`, `vectors`, `lists`, and `sets`,and we've learned how to name these
;; representations with `def` and `let`
;;
;; We have also learned how flexible functions are and how to create our own funcs.
;;
;; We've also been introduced to Clojure's philosophy of simplicity including its uniform
;; syntax and emphasis on using large libraries of funcs on primitive data types.
;;
;; Ch 4 focuses on a detailed examination of Clojure's core functions
;;
;; Ch 5 explains the functional programming mindset
;;
;; This chapter has shownn us how to write Clojure code.
;; The next two chapters will show us how to write clojure code well
;;
;; In order to solidify what we've learned, we -have- to start writing code.
;; There is no better way to solidify our Clojure knowledge.
;;
;; The Clojure Cheatsheet is a great reference `http://clojure.org/cheatsheet/`
;;
;; Complete the exercises in the next section to tickle our brain.
;;
;; To test our knowledge even further, try sokme Project Euler challenges `http://www.projecteuler.net/`
;; or get back to 4Clojure problems `https://4clojure.oxal.org/`


;;;
;;; `Exercises`
;;;

;; First 3 exercises can be completed with info from only this chapter
;;
;; Second 3 exercises will require using funcs not yet covered. If they're too hard,
;; revisit them after completing ch 4 and 5

;; 1. Use the `str`, `vector`, `list`, `hash-map`, and `hash-set` functions
(str "This " "is " "a " "string")
(vector 1 2 3)
(list 1 2 3)
(hash-map :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)
(hash-set 1 2 3)

;; 2. Write a func that takes a num and adds 100 to it
(defn add100
  [num]
  (+ num 100))
(add100 25)

;; 3. Write a func `dec-maker` that works exactly like `inc-maker` except with subtraction
(defn dec-maker
  [decrement]
  #(- % decrement))
(def dec9 (dec-maker 9))
(dec9 10)

;; 4. Write a func, `mapset`, that works like `map` except the return val is a `set`
(defn mapset
  "functions like `map` but returns a set"
  ([f] ;; `map` returns a transducer for this case. Beyond my understanding
   (set (map f)))
  ([f coll] ;; simplest case
   (set (map f coll)))
  ([f c1 c2]
   (set (map f c1 c2)))
  ([f c1 c2 c3]
   (set (map f c1 c2 c3)))
  ([f c1 c2 c3 & colls]
   (set (map f c1 c2 c3 colls))))

(map #(+ % 1) [1 1 2 2 3 3])
(mapset #(+ % 1) [1 1 2 2 3 3])

;; 5. Create a function that‚Äôs similar to symmetrize-body-parts except that it has to
;; work with weird space aliens with radial symmetry. Instead of two eyes, arms, legs,
;; and so on, they have five.

;; 6. Create a function that generalizes symmetrize-body-parts and the function you
;; created in Exercise 5. The new function should take a collection of body parts and
;; the number of matching body parts to add. If you‚Äôre completely new to Lisp languages
;; and functional programming, it probably won‚Äôt be obvious how to do this. If you
;; get stuck, just move on to the next chapter and revisit the problem later.‚Äù
